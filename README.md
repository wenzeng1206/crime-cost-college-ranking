This project explores the relationship between U.S. university rankings and their surrounding environments, focusing on local housing prices, tuition levels, and crime rates. I compiled a multi-source dataset by:

Scraping college ranking and tuition data

Pulling ZIP codeâ€“level crime data from a public API

Integrating housing price data from Zillow

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn), I conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis to uncover patterns between institutional prestige and local cost/safety indicators.

The analysis reveals geographic and socioeconomic trade-offs in higher education, offering insight into the unequal landscape of college access in the U.S.
